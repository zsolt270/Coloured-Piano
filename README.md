About the project:
This was my final year project in the university, because of that it is in hungarian. The main aim of the project would be to support the work of special needs teachers in the development of people with mild intellectual disabilities and learning disabilities. Therefore the website is based on the [colour-sheet music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colored_music_notation) based piano learning development method, as it is an excellent but less used method for developing the skills of my target audience. I would use the site to disseminate this type of development method in such a way that it can be made available to more people via the Internet, as in this case it can be used without the need for a traditional piano.

About the implementation:
The implementation follows MVC architecture and every page has its own controller and view file. For the sake of making the urls hungarian, all of the controller files are named in hungarian. The project provides most of the basic website features and a level of protection.

Features:
• Registration and login
• Account verification
• Forgot password feature
• Virtual piano
• Automated inactive accounts deletion with the scheduler.php script that runs on certain times and option to recover the inactive account
Furure development ideas:
• more music sheets
• creating an account settings panel where users can change their user datas: username, email, password etc.
• button to let users switch between the traditional and colour-sheet piano design
• A pointer that helps the student follow the song on the sheet
• improving the security of the website

Used languages and tools:
-HTML | CSS | JS
-Bootstrap
-PHP
-MySql
-Xamp for the local development
-Gmail for developing and testing the email functionality locally

To see the project itself i made short videos about the features and pictures about the design which u can check out in the presentation folder.
