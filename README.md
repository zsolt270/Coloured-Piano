### About the project:
This was my final year project in the university, because of that it is in hungarian. The main aim of the project would be to support the work of special needs teachers in the development of people with mild intellectual disabilities and learning disabilities. Therefore the website is based on the [colour-sheet music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colored_music_notation) based piano learning development method, as it is an excellent but less used method for developing the skills of my target audience. I would use the site to disseminate this type of development method in such a way that it can be made available to more people via the Internet, as in this case it can be used without the need for a traditional piano.

### About the implementation:
The implementation follows the MVC architecture and each page has its own control and view file. To make the URLs in Hungarian, each control file is given a Hungarian name. The project provides most of the basic functionality of the site and a level of security.

### Features:
• Registration and login
• Account verification
• Forgot password feature
• Virtual piano
• Automated deletion of inactive accounts using the scheduler.php script, which runs at certain times. Also the possibility to reset inactive, deleted accounts.

### Future development ideas:
• More music sheets
• Creating an account settings panel where users can change their user data: username, email address, password, etc.
• Button to let users switch between the traditional and colour-sheet piano design
• A pointer that helps the student follow the song on the music sheet
• Improving the security of the website

### Used languages and tools:
-HTML | CSS | JS
-Bootstrap
-PHP
-MySql
-Xamp for the local development
-Gmail for developing and testing the email functionality locally
